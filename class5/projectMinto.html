        <p>Project First One but not the Last One
            Over the last few years, I have had the pleasure of working with this special client on a number of
            occasions, and am always honoured to keep coming back as their wish list evolves. With this project, the
            majority of the furniture came from a previous home but we were here to select all the hard finishes on this
            new build. Kitchen finishes and appliances, bathrooms, living room fireplace and all lighting and tile
            throughout was hand picked by our team. A special appearance of a little mermaid doll was one of the first
            things I ever picked up for this client a few years back and it was nice to see it reappear again in their
            new home. </p>
